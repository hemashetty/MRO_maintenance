# MRO_maintenance
 MRO may be defined as, "All actions which have the objective of retaining 
or restoring an item in or to a state in which it can perform its required function. The actions include 
the combination of all technical and corresponding administrative, managerial, and supervision 
actions." 
MRO operations can be categorised by whether the product remains the property of the customer, i.e. a service is being offered, or whether the product is bought by the reprocessing organisation and sold to any customer wishing to make the purchase .In the former case it may be a backshop operation within a larger organization or smaller operation.
The former of these represents a closed loop supply chain and usually has the scope of maintenance, repair or overhaul of the product. The latter of the categorisations is an open loop supply chain and is typified by refurbishment and remanufacture. The main characteristic of the closed loop system is that the demand for a product is matched with the supply of a used product. Neglecting asset write-offs and exceptional activities the total population of the product between the customer and the service provider remains constant.
Generally speaking, there are four types of maintenance in use:
Preventive maintenance, where equipment is maintained before breakdown occurs.
Operational maintenance, where equipment is maintained in using.
Corrective maintenance, where equipment is maintained after break down. This maintenance is often most expensive because worn equipment can damage other parts and cause multiple damages.
Adaptive maintenance, where equipment is maintained by letting it adapt to new environment.
